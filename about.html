  <p>I'm a 22 year old web developer, a gamer and husband.  I am currently taking a break from school but would love to eventually go back and either get a BS in computer science or a degree in business.</p>
  <p>I've had a passion for building web pages since Jr. High.  However after high school I really wanted to go to College and study psychology, but after figuring out how long I'd need to be in school I thought I should get a degree in web development so I could make some money and go back to get a degree in psychology.  However after a few quarters I was thoroughly hooked on developing web applications.</p>
  <p>When I'm not working on a something for my employer or a personal project I like to spend time with my wife and friends playing board or card games.</p>
